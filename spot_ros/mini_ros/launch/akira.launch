<!-- NOTE:
        Setting Up Joystick:
          - Get Number (you will see something like jsX): ls /dev/input/
          - Make available to ROS: sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/jsX
          - Make sure <param name="dev" type="string" value="/dev/input/jsX" /> is correct in launch

        You can ignore this msg: [ERROR] [1591631380.406690714]: Couldn't open joystick force feedback!
        It just means your controller is missing some functionality, but this package doesn't use it.
